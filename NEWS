# DownscaleR changelog

See the [Releases section](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/releases) for older version changes


## v3.0.0 (14 Jun 2018)

* New user interface for flexible definition of predictors (`prepareData`) and prediction data (`prepareNewData`). 
* New method (neural networks) available for perfect-prog downscaling 
* New workhorse function `downscale` for perfect-prog/MOS downscaling with different methods (GLM, Analogs..., more soon)
* Flexible method calibration/prediction via `downscale.train` and `downscale.predict`
* New helper function for flexible cross-validation experimental setups: `downscale.cv`
* Improved efficiency in `biasCorrection`, including a parallelization option
* New options for a more flexible parametric quantile mapping method design
* All changes in predictor/predictand definition have been double-checked against MeteoLab for consistency
* Other documentation updates and enhancements
* See the updates in the [wiki](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR/wiki) for worked examples

## v3.0.1 (21 Jun 2018)
